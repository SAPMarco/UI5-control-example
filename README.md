# UI5 Extensibility Playground

This is some playground repository for the corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/SAPMarco/SAPMarco.github.io/wiki), in order to play around with some UI5 extensibility features like:

* Extending standard controls
* Creating custom controls
* Creating composite controls
* Creating a library to bundle controls

## Usage

You can just clone this repository, run npm install and use the UI5 tooling to locally host the application in order to debug/learn from it.

I'm open for any feedback or change proposals.
