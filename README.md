# UI5 Extensibility Playground

This is some playground repository for the corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/SAPMarco/SAPMarco.github.io/wiki), in order to play around with some UI5 extensibility features like:

* Extending standard controls
* Creating custom controls
* Creating XMLComposite controls
* Creating a library to bundle controls

## Usage

You can just clone this repository, run npm install and use the [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling) to locally serve the application in order to debug/learn from it. 

Hint: it already uses the livereload-middleware for the [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling), so changes while serving trigger and immediate update in the browser.

```sh
git clone <repository-url>

cd <repository>

npm install

npm start
```

## To Do

- [ ] Adjust tests to present results in UI without console.log

## Q/A

- I'm open for any feedback, pull requests or written change proposals.
- Yes, I deleted everything related to testing on purpose.
- It's just meant to help with my personal learning and as playground for some of the [Wiki](https://github.com/SAPMarco/SAPMarco.github.io/wiki) content.
